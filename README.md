I'm not sure about this one, i guess that the data is in seconds (I'm not sure) so i have one columns with the time in seconds, and to have a better idea i add another columns with the time in Hours. I don't know if this is revelant.


3. What were the participants’ mean world gaze position?

As i said to you i was not sure about this one, so to begin i just did the mean world gaz position on the three differents axis, X Y and Z.

4. What was the lowest, highest and mean gaze confidence for each participant?

On this one for each participant i retrieve the max min and mean for the gaze confidence.

5. take a look at the “saccades” package for R and investigate how we can use it for the Whack-A-Mole eye tracking data.

I'm doing it right now i'm reading the git hub description, i think this can be very usefull in theory but in practice i don't really know. i will continu my research on it
